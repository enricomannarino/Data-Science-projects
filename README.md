# Data Science University Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a collection of my university projects in the field of Data Science! This assortment reflects my commitment, passion, and dedication in the realm of data analysis and machine learning throughout my academic journey.



## Description

The repository contains various folders concerning the different examination projects carried out as a group, each of which may present scripts, reports or presentations, and sometimes even the data used for analysis. 

The analyses were mainly carried out using Python and R, on cloud services such as Colab or Deepnote to exploit the collaborative environment. 

Due to computational limitations, in some cases it was not possible to opt for more complex models with hyperparameter optimisation / k-folds cross validation.

In general, the platforms used were MongoDB, SQLite, Tableau, OpenRefine, Knime.
